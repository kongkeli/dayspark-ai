DaySpark AI 

A minimal, aesthetic AI-style assistant that helps you start each day with clarity and focus.

DaySpark AI transforms a simple sentence like “I want to study today” into animated, personalized insights that guide your day.
Inspired by modern AI dashboards, the app delivers clean UI, smooth motion, and meaningful suggestions — all without requiring an actual AI model (yet).

Built with Next.js + TypeScript, styled with TailwindCSS, and powered by Framer Motion for a polished, fluid experience.

 What it Does

Generates dynamic “daily insights” based on what the user wants to focus on

Uses animated Insight Cards to deliver suggestions in a modern, AI-inspired layout

Includes smart prompt suggestions (chips) that fill the input and generate insights instantly

Fully responsive, clean UI with a dark minimal aesthetic

Built with scalable architecture: easy to plug in a real AI backend later

Why I Built This

I wanted a project that:

shows strong frontend/UI engineering skills

blends animation, interaction, and clean design

feels like a real product, not just a tutorial

can be easily extended with AI or backend features

DaySpark AI is a modern portfolio-ready app that demonstrates UX thinking, component architecture, and polished frontend craft.
